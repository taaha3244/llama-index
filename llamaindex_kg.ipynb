The 4% Tax Credit is based on a 10 -year present value \\ncalculation of 30% of the qualified basis of each building in the Project . For \\nProjects  placed in service after December 31, 2020, the applicable \\npercentage must be no less than 4%.

Below is a snapshot of key information about the two key  review periods. All \\nprojects seeking funding must  apply  to DHCD for a Threshold Review  and Evaluation Score  \\nbefore seeking an allocation of bond cap  through DCHFA. Guidance about the updated \\ntax-exempt  bond allocation process  is available on the DCHFA website at \\nwww.dchfa.org/developers/available -programs/mmrb/ .  \\n \\n DHCD Threshold Review  &  \\nEvaluation Scoring  DCHFA Readiness Review  \\nWhen Are Reviews \\nHeld?  DHCD will open  two Threshold Review and \\nEvaluation Scoring application windows  in \\nJanuary and July of each year . One or  both  \\nsubmission windows may coincide with the \\nrelease of a Consolidated RFP  that will allow \\napplicants to apply for Threshold Review, \\nEvaluation S coring, and gap financing subsidy \\nwith one application.  DCHFA will accept Readiness Review \\nApplications for Bond Cap and associated \\n4% LIHTCs during two application rounds per \\nyear, the first in January and the second in \\nJuly, as resources may allow .  As part of the \\nReadiness Review  Application , a complete \\nDCHFA Stage 2 application is  required.    \\nWhat Types of \\nProjects Have to be \\nReviewed?  Projects seeking the following types of \\nfinancing  will be reviewed for Threshold \\nEligibility and to receive an Evaluation Score : \\n• Gap financing  and other resources \\noffered in DHCD’s annual Consolidated RFP  \\n• 4% LIHTC s \\n• 9% LIHTC s Projec ts seeking tax-exempt bonds and \\nassociated 4% LIHTC s will be reviewed for \\nreadiness  by DCHFA .  The criteria for the \\nevaluation of project readiness is defined by \\nDCHFA on its  website.  \\nWhat Happens After \\nthe Review?  After each application deadline, applications \\nthat meet all the Threshold Eligibility \\nRequirements will move forward to the \\nEvaluation Scoring stage.  Projects will receive \\nan Evaluation S core. Projects will then be \\nnotified of their  Evaluation  Score.   Projects that pass DHCD’s Threshold Review \\nand receive an Evaluation S core may apply to \\nDCHFA in a Readiness Application window when the Project is  ready and able to close \\nwithin six months of appl ying to DCHFA .  \\nDCHFA will review applications received by the \\npublished deadline in January and July, provide \\na cure period for deficiencies, and  will set the \\npipeline for the following six -month period by \\nranking Projects based on the Project’s \\nEvaluation Score  from hi gh to low scores.  \\nWhere Are \\nApplications \\nSubmitted?

DHCD \\nhas also continued several ongoing discussions with our partner agencies, including the DCHFA , \\nthe Department of Energy & Environment, Office of Planning, and the Mayor’s Office for Policy  \\nand Innovation.  The Department has thoroughly reviewed all comments , and a summary of all \\ncomments received and DHCD’s responses are provided below.  \\nFor all Evaluation C riteria, further clarity and guidance related to requireme nts and allocation \\nof points will be provided in the Online Application, as well as the  most current  Consolidated \\nRequest for Proposals for Affordable Housing Projects (Affordable Housing RFP or RFP) \\nthrough which the 9% Tax Credits  and gap financing  are a warded.   \\nCompetitive Application Review and Selection Process  \\nDHCD received several comments about the new competitive tax -exempt bond and 4% LIHTC \\nallocation process that was instituted in January 2023. One comment supported the process \\nand urged DHCD to continue prioritization of “Transition Projects ,” and suggested \\nprioritization of bond cap for projects selected for development by DMPED or for funding via \\nDHCD’s Consolidated RFP . The Evaluation Criteria  currently include preference points for \\nprojects that use District land.   \\nSeveral commenters submitted questions about timing and how the process will work. Specifically, \\none commenter asked if projects still need to make a Stage I application to DCHFA, or if the DHCD Threshold Review is effectiv ely now the Stage I application. A Stage I application for preliminary \\ninducements can be submitted within 60 days of a Project’s acquisition date, per IRS requirements, \\nin order to ensure acquisition/rehabilitation projects can fund acquisition with tax exempt bonds. If \\nthis preliminary inducement is not applicable, the DCHFA Stage I application is not required prior to the DHCD Threshold Review and Evaluation Scoring submission. A complete DCHFA Stage 2 \\napplication is required for the DCHFA Readiness Revi ew Application.

DHCD is currently evaluating this suggestion, especially in the context of the newly competitive bond cap allocation process and its implications for project timelines and carrying costs.  \\nPreservation and Net New Units \\nDHCD received several comments concerned that the prioritization of net new units over the \\npreservation of existing housing subject to af fordability covenants could result in displacement, \\nand the loss of irreplaceable subsidies and units. One commenter asked that the preference \\nfor projects proposed by or in partnership with tenant groups that exercised their Tenant \\nOpportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA) right, and/or those acquired through the District \\nOpportunity to Purchase Act (DOPA), the Housing Preservation Fund, and/or the Site \\nAcquisition Funding Initiative (SAFI) be reinstated.  \\nThe definition of Net New Units encompasses any unrestric ted unit that will be placed under \\nan affordability covenant as a result of DHCD financing ; as such, it is possible for certain \\npreservation projects to produce net new units. Further, many rehabilitation projects may be \\neligible for points in the \\nRisk of Loss of Affordability in the Near Term (NOAH or Covenanted)  \\nsub-category. Points available in this sub -category have been increased from five to seven. A \\npreservation set- aside or additional points for preservation projects was suggested beyond \\nthis change, as well as a broader definition of a risk to the loss of affordability to include a level of project need or disrepair that would cor relate with an urgent need for renovation financing. \\nWhile DHCD understands and appreciates many of the concerns raised, the Department has \\nfound that many preservation projects continue to score competitively in DHCD application \\nrounds. No further change has been made to these categories at this time.  \\nSimilarly, DHCD received comments urging a balanced approach between enc ouraging \\naffordable housing production west of Rock Creek Park and ensuring reinvestment into existing Ward 7 and 8 communities at risk of losing housing viability or affordability located in historically disinvested areas in need of broader community stab ilizing investments. DHCD \\nagrees with the sentiment of this comment, and notes that over half of the developments selected in the General Evaluation Round of the 2021 Consolidated RFP were in Wards 7 and 8, and two of those involved preservation of existing housing coupled with construction of net new units.  \\nThe current QAP and the points associated with proposed developments west of Rock Creek \\nPark and in other amenity - and resource -rich Planning Areas are aligned with the Mayor’s \\nhousing production goals as stated in the 2019 Housing Equity Report. Those goals were \\nintended, in part, to facilitate a more equitable distribution of affordable housing citywide as a \\ncounterbalance to existing market forces and do not preclude financing of housing preservation in Wards 7 and 8.  \\nWith these concerns in mind, the RFP already  reward s developments that aim  to counter the \\nhistoric under investment in broader community needs and interests of  the Far Southeast and \\nSouthwest and the Far Northeast and Southeast Planning Areas located east of the Anacostia ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

DHCD will continue to review and adjust priorities and point distribution in the QAP \\nand the RFP as needed.  \\nResident Services Plans  \\nDHCD received several comments in support of adding the written Resident Services Plan as a \\nthreshold requirement, adding that it is a best practice seen across other jurisdictions . These \\ncommenters, however, also expressed concerns about how resident services should be funded. \\nSpecifically, one commenter  strongly opposed any requirement that resident services be paid \\nfrom developer fee or outside funding, which may be unpredictable.  The commenter noted that \\nif consistent, high -qual ity services are the goal, sponsors should be encouraged to incorporate \\nthese costs within the property's operating budget.  \\nOne commenter acknowledged that the 2023 QAP responded to their suggestion made in \\n2021 to allow applicants to leverage the funding of resident service programs by paying for it \\nthrough the developer fee that is capitalized into the LIHTC basis. It was noted, correctly, that \\nthe 2023 QAP now states that “a portion of developer fee [can be] reserved for this purpose.”  \\nThis commenter als o suggested that DHCD explore alternative approaches to funding resident \\nservices. One idea is from Maryland’s QAP which recently added a provision allowing sponsors to request up to an additional 5% above the developer fee limit if the additional fee is d edicated to \\nfund a resident services reserve at the time a project comes online. The commenter also suggested an alternative approach: to incentivize capitalization of resident services funds in project \\ndevelopment budgets separate from additional developer fees. DHCD will not consider increasing developer fee to fund services since, unlike most other jurisdictions including those that commenters referenced, DHCD has no dollar cap on developer fee (for example, a total fee limit of $4 million or some other limit). Applicants can choose to propose setting aside a portion of developer fee to fund resident services. DHCD will continue to assess this criteria, specifically how resident services are paid for and how that aligns with DHCD developer fee policy.  \\nCommenters also sought clarification as to whether outside funding for resident services is \\nrequired.  In the 2023 QAP, there are two areas where the Resident Services Plan is \\nconsidered. First, as a Threshold Requirement,  each project is required to submit a  written \\nResident Services Plan. The Plan should discuss how the resident services will be funded and sustained for at least 15 years. Second, a Project can earn  points in the \\nResident Services  sub-\\ncategory of the  Evaluation Criteria  for demonstrating that  outside funding is secured for a \\nportion of the services budget ( up to 33% , up to 50% , or over 80% of the budget ). DHCD is \\nnot requiring a specific type of funding structure, but does suggest that sources could include organizational fundraising, a portio n of developer fee reserved for this purpose, a combination \\nof developer fee and fundraising, etc. While  this prioritization was  not changed at this time, \\nadditional clarification has been provided for  the minimum Threshold Requirements .  \\nOne commenter noted that the cumulative points for the category in the Evaluation Criteria was \\neffectively reduced from 25 total points to 15 points (between the nine points for \\nResident Services  \\nplus six points for Community -Oriented Amenities ).

Many of the comments spoke to the Ho using Production Trust Fund (HPTF) statutory requirements. \\nWhile the QAP governs a federal resource, DHCD is committed to coordinating resources, so \\nthey are best leveraged to meet the needs of the city’s lowest income households.  \\nFor reference, t he Housi ng Production Trust Fund Act of 1988  requires  that each fiscal year:  \\n• At least 50 percent of HPTF funds obligated shall serve extremely low -\\nincome households (with incomes at or below 30 percent of Area Median \\nIncome (AMI) or Area Median Gross Income (AMGI) ). \\n• At least 40 percent of funds obligated shall  serve very low -income \\nhouseholds , with incomes between 30 percent and 50 percent AM GI. \\n• The balance of funds can serve low -income households with incomes up to \\n80 percent AM GI. \\nDHCD received a comment in support of the flexibility provided by the \\nIncome Levels Served \\ncategory within the Evaluation Criteria, noting that the weighted average of income levels served may assist preservation projects that are occupied by existing tenants. However, the commente r expressed concern that this section may duplicate preference points awarded under \\nthe \\nMixed Income  category. The commenter suggested that it would be beneficial to reflect and \\nrepeat the importance of adhering to the Housing Production Trust Fund income targeting requirements. DHCD understands this concern but is not making a change at this time.  \\nDHCD received one comment suggesting the \\nMixed Income  Evaluation Criteria category receive \\nfewer points, and another opposing a scoring priority for providing ma rket-rate units.

DHCD strongly supports communities that offer housing for a range of household incomes, and must make resources available to household s with a wide variety of income levels.   \\nTwo commenters shared that it is more important to select projects that best respond to critical needs, particularly those that advance the HPTF statutory income targets, instead of focusing on requirements for developer qualifications. DH CD’s development team criteria help \\nto ensure that projects have a high likelihood of being completed and are brought through pre -\\ndevelopment, construction completion, and into sustainable long -term operations as proposed. \\nThe new \\nDeveloper Capacity Buildi ng sub-category to the Evaluation Criteria prioritizes \\nprojects with developers with limited experience.  \\nHousing for Older Adults  \\nDHCD received comments in favor of separating Housing for Older Adults and Accessible \\nHousing into two categories, and speci fying applicants to follow the Virginia Universal Design \\nStandard. DHCD also received two comments suggesting that the Housing for Older Adults point category not require applying accessibility standards to all housing units in the development.  The 2021 Q AP did award points for projects that included units designed and \\nreserved for seniors and/or people with disabilities, with maximum preference awarded to Projects for seniors (55+) in which all units met either the Uniform Federal Accessibility \\nStandards (UFAS) or the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Type A accessibility \\nstandards. The 2023 QAP, however, acknowledges the differentiated needs of seniors and \\nother special -needs groups by allocating points to both Housing for Older Adults and \\nAcce ssible Housing. Applicants may receive points for the Housing for Older Adults category if \\ntheir proposed mix fully complies with the Fair Housing Act and Housing for Older Persons Act \\nof 1995 (HOPA) Exemption.  DHCD disagrees with the assertion that requir ing certain  \\naccessibility stan dards for housing for older adults  is an unreasonable requirement to obtain \\npoints.  DHCD is of the opinion that requiring units for older adults to have a minimal standard \\nsuch as ANSI Type A units allows residents to age in p lace and prolong their ability to stay in \\ntheir community.  \\nOne commenter asked for clarity on the point allocation for age restricted housing for people \\n62+ or age restricted housing for people 55+. Points will be awarded to applicants regardless of which of the three HOPA Exemptions they qualify for: (1) developments specifically designed \\nand operated to assist elderly persons; (2) developments intended for, and solely occupied by persons 62 years of age or older; and (3) developments intended and operated  for occupancy \\nby persons 55 years of age or older. One additional point is awarded to Projects that target \\nthe 62+ age range.  \\nAccessible Housing  \\nDHCD received a comment recommending against requiring projects to meet ANSI Type A \\nstandards for all housing units. The 2023 QAP awards points for Projects where all units meet \\nthe American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Type A accessibility standard s.

These standards are meant to ensure that a percentage of units are accessible, or that all building units are adaptable.  \\nPoints for Wealth -Building and Other Program  Suggestions  \\nDHCD received comments recommending the following changes to the scoring:  \\n• Additional points in the \\nHomeownership and Wealth- Building  category for \\nProjects providing homeownership opportunities;  \\n• Elimination of the Maximizing Density  point category; \\n• Additional points for Maximizing Impact of DHCD Resources ;  \\n• A standalone scoring opportunity for victims of domestic violence in the \\nPrograms to Address Additional Barriers to Housing  category; and  \\n• Reincorporation of partial points in the Resilient Buildings and Innovative \\nDesign  category for preservation projects  \\nIn regard to the above suggestions, DHCD will continue to assess the impact of the  current  \\nchanges to the Evaluation Criteria in this and future application rounds, but has not made further updates to the Evaluation Criteria at this time.  \\nOne commenter suggested adding a new evaluation criteria with a preference for small buildings of 50 units  or less. DHCD does not intend to add a preference for small buildings at this time.  \\nNon -Profit Participation and Right of First Refusal  \\nSeveral commenters wrote to suggest specific changes to the Right of First Refusal (ROFR) requirements: one suggested that the ROFR be effective after the end of the credit period; \\nanother that the purchase price calculated by the project accountants be deemed final other \\nthan due to manifest error. The requirements in the QAP related to a ROFR are considered the \\nminimum requirements; terms that may be more favorable to the holder of the ROFR are \\nsubject to negotiation between the developer and its investor.  \\nDHCD will monitor investor exit and Year 15 issues as they arise. Several industry partners are monitoring current litigation and other Year 15 issues across the country, and may be the best \\nresource for non- profit organizations in their partnership searches and negotiations.  \\nOne commenter suggested that this category be re -named to better reflect the focus on the \\nright of first refusal, and that points match the 2021 QAP  (a two -point reduction from the \\n2023 QAP) . DHCD will monitor the impact of this change to the scoring criteria, and will make \\nany necessary adjustments in future QAPs/RFPs . \\nAffordability  Period Restriction  \\nOne commente r suggested  that a perpetual affordability restriction –  defined as a term of 99 \\nyears – be a Threshold requirement for all projects awarded LIHTC, or that the points awarded \\nfor projects selecting perpetual affordability be increased .

Further, m any projects selected in the past several QAP and RFP rounds have \\ncommitted to perpetual affordability , and have received prioritization points for this \\ncommitment. In this regard, DHCD is  largely  in line with its peer allocating agencies, many of \\nwhom distinguish affordability requirements and priori tization between credit types, and \\nwhether or not projects receive  public gap financing in addition to LIHTC allocations.  \\nIn this update to the QAP, DHCD will award maximum available points in the Affordability \\nPeriod Restriction  sub-category to projects that utilize a  developer -initiated  ground lease  held \\nby the District,  emphasizing  another viable tool for ensuring long -term affordability  outside of \\na covenant alone.
